# Mice_Sorting
Sort mice into groups so each group has around the same weight.

The code reads the mice data (name and weight) from an excel file and then creates groups so each group weighs around the same.

The file "Mice weights.xlsx" is a sample. The settings in main.py are set for this file. Can be changed when you try your own file according to your needs.
